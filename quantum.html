        <p class="miniText"> As part of the Quantum Creators Con, I participated as a design lead in a multidisciplinary team alongside 
            another designer and two technical leads. Our challenge was to translate complex concepts in quantum computing into engaging, 
            digestible content. We created an interactive cookbook that explains quantum principles through culinary metaphors and visual 
            storytelling.
        </p>

    <div class="mainText">
    <div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; color:#fddcbc;">Ideation</h2>
        <p> We began with a brainstorming session that produced 50+ potential ideas for how to make quantum computing more accessible to the 
            public. From this pool, we narrowed our concepts to five (including a scavenger hunt, a comic, and an album rollout), ultimately 
            selecting the cookbook approach for its metaphorical strength and broad appeal.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; color:#fddcbc;">Research and Visualization</h2>
        <p> Prior to, during, and after the ideation session, our group conducted interviews and research to inform our
            project. Firstly, we conducted interview with 3 industry professionals about the success, shortcomings, and their goals for 
            not only the future of quantum computing but the future of scientific literacy, information sharing, and understanding
            from the general public. After conducting those 3 interviews, we held a research survey asking the general public 
            about their knowledge on quantum computing.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were able to survey 31 individuals in the span of a few hours guaging their familiarity with classical and quantum computing,
            their interest in learning quantum concepts, and the preferred learning contexts. We gathered the following insights:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A large amount of our participants do not understand classical computing (the basis of understanding
                    quantum computing).
                </li>
                <li>
                    A large amount of our participants had no knowledge or very little knowledge of quantum computing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A large amount of our participants would be interesting in learning more about quantum computing if they
                    had personal interest or through academic/intellectual pursuit.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Additionally, participants gave feedback on their general thoughts on quantum computing and the future of technology/scientific 
            literacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            While conducting the survey, we started compiling visual references/moodboards shape the cookbook's style and tone!

            Implementation + User Testing
        </h2>
        <p>
            We created a lo-fi prototype where each quantum concept was paired with a corresponding recipe. The technical leads developed the "recipes" for the cookbook,
            while the design leads developed the content, design, and visual explanations of each concept. 
            
            After creating our lo-fi document, we started conducting user testing and received
            extremely positive results.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Participant's understanding of the concepts provided increased.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Many participants understanding increased greatly (3+ levels of measurable understanding).
                </li>
            </ul>
            Following this, we built the final prototype using Figma, Photoshop, and Illustrator focusing on visual clarity,
            consistency, and engagement.
