        <p class="miniText"> A tactile, arcade-style controller designed for a rhythm game using Makey Makey and laser-cut
             acrylic. I explored multiple physical interface concepts before developing a fully functional button matrix with 
             custom wiring, game-matched visuals, and a transparent housing to showcase the internal circuitry. This project focused 
             on playful interaction design, hardware prototyping, and responsive physical UX.

        <h2 style="text-align: center; color:#fddcbc;">Ideation</h2>
        <p> When approaching the physical interface for the rhythm game, I explored a range of interactive concepts—some playful, some ambitious, 
            all with different technical and user interaction implications.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Toy Guitar: <br>
                    I considered repurposing a toy guitar, leveraging its natural hand placement and playful form. The idea was to create touch-sensitive fret regions to act 
                    as gameplay inputs, offering a familiar and fun interaction model.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mini Piano Keys: <br>
                A four-key piano setup was another early direction. I explored the possibility of 3D printing the keys and using conductive materials like aluminum foil 
                or play-doh to register touch with an Arduino board. This path offered creative flexibility but would require more time for prototyping and tuning responsiveness.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drawing Tablet (OSU! Inspired): <br>
                Drawing inspiration from OSU, I considered recreating a DIY drawing tablet to allow users to control cursor motion. While exciting, this direction presented 
                challenges in replicating real-time responsiveness and accuracy with the resources available.
            </li>
            <li>
                Simple Button Matrix: <br>
                Ultimately, I decided on building a custom button matrix, a tactile and straightforward interface that would prioritize responsiveness and physicality. It provided
                the best balance between feasibility, functionality, and room for design customization.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The final interface goals were to prioritize four main game input butons, explore potential additions if time allows (ie volume control, back button, etc.),
            and design for both usability and aesthetic appeal.

        <h3>Hardware and Wiring</h3>
        <p> The core interaction relied on mapping physical button presses to keyboard inputs using a Makey Makey board. However, I quickly ran into a technical hiccup: 
            while most tutorials used 2-pin buttons, I was working with 4-pin hardware. After researching how the current flows through 4-pin setups, I manually mapped each 
            button to the Makey Makey using jumper cables and alligator clips. I carefully identified vertical pin pairings (not horizontal), connected each button's input and grounded
            pin accordingly, and considered daisy-chaining grounds to save wiring but found it unfeasible for this configuration. Despite the limitation, I successfully configured all intended
            buttons, ensuring the key inputs for the gameplay were functional and responsive.
        </p>
        <img src="images/rhythm_images/wiring.jpeg" style="width:60%;">
        <h3>Enclosure and Visual Design</h3>
        <p>
            To make the interface feel cohesive and user-friendly, I designed a custom enclosure using clear and colored laser-cut acrylic. I wanted to showcase the internal 
            circuitry while maintaining a playful, arcade-like aesthetic.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Created box layout and cut guides in Illustrator.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sourced available acrylic in four colors corresponding to in-game visuals.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Designed each button to match the game's UI using the colored acrylic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Engraved the game's logo on the front-facing panel.
                </li>
            </ul>
            I chose to glue the box pieces together rather than using joints, aiming for a smooth seamless finish.

        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <p>
            For the button mounting, I laser-cut cardboard stacks using a Cricut to ensure 
            perfect alignment and spacing. Initially, the buttons would sink when pressed, disrupting play. To fix this, I
            taped the buttons to stabilize their position, reduced the number of stacked layers for optimal responsiiveness,
            and adjusted button cap sizes to better fit the top plate.
            <br>
            After discovering that the buttons stuck out too far from the box top, I added extra acrylic layers to increase surface height.

            Testing
        </h2>
        <p>
            During final testing, button caps occasionally slipped under their holes due to lack of rigidity. While it 
            functioned well with controlled pressing, I proposed several improvements for broader usability:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Adding paper walls around each button hole.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Taping the caps to the actual buttons for fixed alignment
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reinforcing cap structure with additional base materials.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Although not implemented in the final prototype, these adjustments would be essential for real-world 
            use and user playtesting.
