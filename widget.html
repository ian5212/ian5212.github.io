        <p class="miniText"> This project was developed as part of NYU’s Ideation and Prototyping course. Tasked with 
            addressing accessibility gaps in public transit, I conceptualized and designed a widget that enhances the MTA 
            app’s utility, particularly for users with disabilities and commuters seeking hyperlocal, real-time information.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="mainText">
    <div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; color:#fddcbc;">Ideation</h2>
        <p> The original idea began as a full redesign of the MTA app. However, user and stakeholder feedback guided a more 
            focused direction: creating a standalone widget that would serve users based on their geographic location and deliver 
            critical, glanceable transit data.

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; color:#fddcbc;">Research and Visualization</h2>
        <p> Before designing, two important aspects needed to occur: application research and rider research.
        </p>
        <h3>Application Research</h3>
        <p>
            I conducted a competitive review of apps including Train Time, Railway, Subway, Citymapper, and MTA’s native app. This 
            revealed common pain points such as inconsistent accessibility info and poor live-update performance. These insights 
            helped shape survey questions and functional priorities.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Rider Research
        </h3>
        <p>
            I surveyed 14 colleged-aged NYC transit riders students to understand their feedback regarding app usage, accessibility needs,
            and transit completion. The survey gave the following insights:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Specific asks from the survey: In the bottom section of the survey, a lot of people said that a main 
                    improvement they want from transit apps were more accurate times/service updates; Someone mentioned 
                    seeing possible transfer trains/buses would be arriving at the station, clearer lists of where the 
                    next closest stations are as well as their next train arrival time, seeing specific station with the 
                    times more easily, a widget, updated formats, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    69.2% were not aware of the next ADA compliant station or station that has an elevator via an app, and 
                    76.9% were not aware of its location via an app                
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most people had a agreeable response to knowing only specific local stations, while an overwhelming 
                    majority would want to be aware of local train stations and time around their destination.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most people are comfortable not using a transit app for some to all travel
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Participants also provided a list of transit applications they have used to navigate NYC transit.
        </p>

            Design 
        </h2>
        <p>
            Over three iterations, I devloped a widget UI emphasizing accessibility, immediacy, and customization.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Colors indicating how close each train is (5+ minutes away being green, 4-2 minutes away being yellow,
                    and 1-0 minutes away being red)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The final stop on each train added as some train routes are dependent on the final stop which is not always
                    the same station
                </li>
                <li>
                    Showcasing the time of the following train afterwards and not only the next train.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A section dedicated for any service updates, rerouting, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The widget was also updated to include the images of the "train bullets" as a visual reminder of which train/line is arriving
            at the station. Simultaneously, all typography was made to be the same as the MTA standard typography
            usage (Helvetica). Additionally, an update button was added at the top for the user to be able to update their geographical location
            if the widget does not automatically refresh.
